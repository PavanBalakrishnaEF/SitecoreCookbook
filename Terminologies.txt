1)RenderModel (Sitecore.Mvc.Presentation) - passed to a View rendering as a model object(Default)
2)CustomItem (Sitecore.Data.Items) - A superset of Sitecore.Item which takes an 'item' as a constructor input(BreadCrumItem)
3)View rendering should pass model if 'Model.' is being referenced and the model passed in sitecore should match the model in the View else 
the following error comes - https://www.screencast.com/t/LqsPei72A
4)Placeholder settings are only used in experience editors for dynamic rendering
5)Placeholder settings key MUST match a placeholder on a Rendererlayout page

Data sources

1)By default the datasource is the Context item
2)Renderings can have explicit data sources
3)Rendering linked to Data source in 'Rendering' class
4)Data sources can be used for personalization

Admin pages
1)http://sitecore91.local/sitecore/admin/stats.aspx = View stats of pages


Events
1)Attach custom handlers to events through patching example - item:saved

Jobs?

*)Versioned layouts - Different layout versions for different languages .Shared layout will contain common renderings for all language
.Final layout will contain additional renderings for that language (Delta)

*)Dictionary - Used as global placeholders for common texts ,  can have separate dictionaries for each site

*)Alias- present in the 'Presentation' screen , can add a vanity URL to an existing URL (Entry created in Sitecore/System/Alias/)

*)Clones - Useful in multisite setup ,  create a clone of an item from Site A to Site B (Site B inherits Site A  (changes on A reflect in B )
as long as Site B item does not change the value after that they are separate)

*)Wildcard items 

Designing Sitecore sites
See - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbWhBUXO5Pc&t=31s
*)Create data templates(Templates) and components (Data sources for rendering)
*)Personalization and testing always requires data templates (Content items that are not pages)

1)Branch Templates
2)Gutter
3)Sitecore domain - extranet and sitecore (Security domains)
4)Security editor used to give permission to content items (Even workflow actions)
5)Access viewer  - to display stay of access
6)Sitecore buckstes -Used yo group unorganised content items based on some criteria (Like created date and re organize them

Marketting
Goals - 
1)Can be set to pages and click events (On form submits ) 
2)Goalds can have engamenet values and based on those values we can set personalization
3)Personalization can be set based on if a goal is triggered

campaigns
1)Campaign are of two types - Online and offline
2)Online campaigns are items which create a unique querystring URL that needs to be appended to campaign URL(On sitecore pages and even referring URLs)
3)Onlien campaigns (Digital like social media pages and emails etc ) need to have campagn querystring appended to them so sitecore identifies the campagin
4)Offline campaigns are linked to a sitecore page (Preferably with a Alias so its easy to rememeber)

Taxonomies and facets
1)Taxonomies are used for classification of things like campaigns and goals
2)Facets are used for furthur classification (More specific)
